>  Dear Dolores:
  When I think of you, I'm reminded of the beautiful plains of Iowa.
  The distance between us is breaking my spirit...
  My time and experiences without you are meaningless to me.
  Falling in love with you was the simplest thing I have ever done.
  Nothing matters to me but you.
  And every day I am alive, I'm aware of this.
  I loved you the day I met you, I love you today...
  And I will love you to the rest of my life.
  P.S. Kiss the kids.

课上又想起来这段话，就随手记在这里了。

时至今日，我还是喜欢用纸质的信来传达心意。

电影如下
